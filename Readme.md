Connect Hesabfa Online Accounting to Prestashop.

== Description ==
This plugin helps connect your (online) store to Hesabfa online accounting software. By using this plugin, saving products, contacts, and orders in your store will also save them automatically in your Hesabfa account. Besides that, just after a client pays a bill, the receipt document will be stored in Hesabfa as well. Of course, you have to register your account in Hesabfa first. To do so, visit Hesabfa at the link here www.hesabfa.com and sign up for free. After you signed up and entered your account, choose your business, then in the settings menu/API, you can find the API keys for the business and import them to the plugin settings. Now your module is ready to use.
